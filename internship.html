            <p class="title">Overview</p>
            <p class="explain">I had an opportunity that works as a UX design apprentice at BRIDGEGOOD. BRIDGEGOOD is a non-profit organization that supports design students develop their skills and industry knowledge. My teammates and I were assigned a design sprint to create the internship/entry-level job opportunities feature to provide inclusive and accessible job opportunities for entry-level design students. During work with my tames, I had a chance to do user interviews and finalized high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

            <p class="title">Problem</p>
            <p class="explain">Job hunting is not easy for students since they lack experience. Besides, most companies prefer applicants with more than two years of experience, and they post many requirements on the job posting. It makes students overwhelmed and hesitant to apply. Students from the BRIDGEGOOD UX Design Apprenticeship have limited-to-no industry experience and want to gain real-world experience by getting hired for an internship.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>It is natural to have new assumptions while building new products. And it is crucial to validate the assumption with users.</li>
                <li>It is okay to go back to the previous phase while developing products. It gives me the possibility to find uncovered facts. The iteration of all stages allowed me to create a better solution.</li>
                <li>It provides a chance to deal with multiple users. This project has to satisfy various perspectives since the target audiences were students, companies, and stakeholders. I had an opportunity to find the middle point to give them the confidence to use it.</li>
                <li>It is important to focus on accessibility and usability but also needs to understand the business goals and values.</li>
