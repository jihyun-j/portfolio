            <p class="title">Overview</p>
            <p>This is my passion project that taught me the fundamentals and process of UX design. The inspiration for my project was based on a documentary called ‚ÄòToxic Beauty‚Äô that showcased how harmful cosmetics and personal care products can be to the human body. I designed the Checkco app in a way that was easy to use, and helpful in checking the ingredients of cosmetic and personal care products for those that wanted to avoid harmful chemicals and be conscious of what they were using on their bodies.</p>

            <p>We use the same products in the shower yet have no idea what the active ingredients are. People regularly use skincare products without knowing whether or not the product they are using is safe to use. Furthermore, the listed ingredients are mixed with chemical jargon making it difficult for the average person to understand without any explanations.</p>

            <p>I learned a lot during this case study particularly about the UX fundamentals.
