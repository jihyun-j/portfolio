          <p class="profile-content">I have loved drawing and creating when I was young, but I am always curious about the vast world and cultures. I studied international trading and worked in sales for one and a half years. But, it provoked my passion for designing while I worked with a design agency to redesign the company website. What I loved about the design agency was imagining freely and out of the box and making the imagination tangible for users. Currently, I embrace and utilize my prior career in deeply understanding users' needs and pain points and designing valuable and inclusive products for clients as a UI/UX designer.</p>  
          <p class="profile-content"> I enjoy cooking, hiking, and watching movies in my free time, and my recent interest in ceramic art boosts my creativity and following my hometown culture in South Korea. </p>
